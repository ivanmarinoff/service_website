- [Freelance service App](https://freelance-services.onrender.com)


This is a personal project for a car diagnostics and repair brokerage site. 
Freelance car mechanics who register on the platform are expected to participate in the project.


Upon receiving a request for diagnostics or car repair from a customer, the administrator directs the same to the available mechanics.

After reviewing the customer request, the mechanics decide if they will accept it and when they will fulfil it. 
For the accepted and fulfilled request, they receive the agreed remuneration for the service.

Accordingly, the customer has the opportunity to write feedback about their satisfaction with the service received 
to the administrator and to the relevant mechanic.
